****************** INSTALLING SOURCEMOD *********************
* Installing sourcemod is fairly easy, if you want to use what 
* I've supplied then go ahead, however I recommend going into *"admins_simple.ini" and changing it to your STEAMID. The rest *is simple, extract into left4dead2/left4dead2 and you'll have *it all prepped. I'll keep this updated with the latest version *of metamod and sourcemod. Enjoy.
